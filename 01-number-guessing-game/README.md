🧠 STEP 01: Number Guessing Game

Difficulty: Very basic
Goal: Build logic confidence
Concepts used:

- variables

- Math.random()

- if / else

- basic DOM

- events

This project is famous for a reason. If you can do this comfortably, your JS foundation is good.

🧠 STEP 2: Understand the Game (Before Coding)

Rules of the game:

Computer picks a random number between 1 and 10

User types a number

Clicks “Guess”

JS tells:

- “Too high”

- “Too low”

- “Correct 🎉”

That’s it. Nothing fancy.
